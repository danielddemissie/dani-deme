This is a step-by-step guide to building and deploying a blog site with `Hugo` and `Vercel`. Let's get started!

<br />

### 1. Install Hugo

#### Installing Hugo on Linux

If your distribution supports `snap`:

```bash

snap install hugo --channel=extended

```

Or you can use `apt-get`:

```bash

sudo  apt-get  install  hugo

```

Check if Hugo is successfully installed:

```bash

hugo  version

```

If you get a response similar to the one below, Hugo is successfully installed:

```bash

hugo  v0.105.0-0e3b42b4a9bdeb4d866210819fc6ddcf51582ffa+extended  linux/amd64  BuildDate=2022-10-28T12:29:05Z  VendorInfo=snap:0.105.0

```

If you are using Windows, follow this instruction: [hugo-windows](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#windows)

<br />

### 2. Create a New Site

After installing Hugo, let's create your blog site:

1. Open your terminal.
2. `cd` to your preferred working directory.
3. Create a new Hugo site with your chosen blog site name:

```bash

hugo  new  site  blog-site

```

This will provide short instructions on how to add a theme and content to your site. We'll cover these steps in detail below.

```bash
Just a few more steps and you're ready to go:

1. Download a theme into the same-named folder.
Choose a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/ or
create your own with the "hugo new theme <THEMENAME>" command.

2. Perhaps you want to add some content. You can add single files
with "hugo new <SECTIONNAME>/<FILENAME>.<FORMAT>".

3. Start the built-in live server via "hugo server".

Visit https://gohugo.io/ for quickstart guide and full documentation.

```

### 3. Use a Hugo Theme

Hugo makes it easy to add and manage themes for your site's UI/UX. Once you select a [Hugo Theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/), you can add it to your site using one of these two methods:

1. Add the selected theme's Git repository as a `subtree` to your site (recommended if you want to follow updates from the theme's repository).
2. Manually download or clone the theme's Git repository into your site's `themes` directory (use this if you are satisfied with the current version and don't need future updates).

For this guide, let's use [m10c](https://github.com/vaga/hugo-theme-m10c.git), a theme similar to this blog site.

```bash
cd  themes
git  clone  https://github.com/vaga/hugo-theme-m10c.git  ./m10c

```

<br />

### 4. Update the `config.toml`

Now, update your `config.toml` file to include:

- The theme you are using
- Author information
- Available menus
- Social media links, and more

Open your `config.toml` file and add the following information:

> **Remember to change the data to your own information.**

```bash
languageCode  =  "en-us"
title  =  "Daniel's Blog"
theme  =  "m10c"

[[menu.main]]

identifier  =  "tags"
name  =  "Tags"
url  =  "/tags/"
weight  =  2

[[menu.main]]

identifier  =  "home"
name  =  "Home"
url  =  "/"
weight  =  1

[params]
author  =  "Daniel Demelash"
description  =  "The little things I know about software development."
avatar  =  "images/profile_pic.png"

#add avatar image
menu_item_separator  =  "|"
favicon  =  "images/favicon.ico"

#add favico image
[[params.social]]
icon  =  "github"
name  =  "GitHub"
url  =  "https://github.com/danielddemissie"

[[params.social]]
icon  =  "linkedin"
name  =  "Linkedin"
url  =  "https://linkedin.com/in/danielddemissie"

[[params.social]]
icon  =  "twitter"
name  =  "Twitter"
url  =  "https://twitter.com/danielddeme"
```

For this to work properly, you need to add the `favicon` and `avatar` images inside both the `public/images` and `static/images` folders, using the same file names.

<br />

### 5. Create Your First Post

Now it's time to add your first blog post. First, go back to the main directory and run this command:

```bash

cd  ..

hugo  new  posts/first-post.md

```

This command creates a `posts` directory with a file named `first-post.md` inside the `content` folder. When you open this file in your text editor, you'll see a line `draft = true`, which means the post is in draft mode. Add your content to this file and change `draft = false`. After saving your changes, run the following commands:

```bash
hugo
hugo  server

```

The `hugo` command will generate the necessary configuration and HTML files to render your site.

```

Start building sites …

hugo v0.105.0-0e3b42b4a9bdeb4d866210819fc6ddcf51582ffa+extended linux/amd64 BuildDate=2022-10-28T12:29:05Z VendorInfo=snap:0.105.0

```

`hugo server` will start the application on port 1313 (if no other service is running on that port). Now that your blog site is up and running, open [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) in your browser.

<br />

### 6. Push to GitHub

Create a new GitHub repository with your site name and copy the repository URL.

_Note: I rename the main branch from `master` to `main` simply because I prefer `main`._

```bash
git  init
git  add  -A
git  commit  -m  "START: first commit"
git  branch  -M  main
git  remote  add  origin  url-to-your-blog-repository
git  push  -u  origin  main

```

### 7. Deploy to Vercel

Vercel is a platform for frontend developers, providing the speed and reliability needed to create and deploy projects quickly. They also offer one of the best free (Hobby) account services.

If you don't have a Vercel account, create a free account and then come back here.

Deploying your Hugo site to Vercel does not require any additional configuration. All you have to do is push the changes you want to deploy to the `main` branch of your project repository, and Vercel will automatically configure and deploy your Hugo site.

Let's deploy! First, make sure everything is saved, then run:

```bash
git  add  .
git  commit  -m  "DEPLOY: deploy to vercel"
git  push
```

#### Open your Vercel dashboard and add a new project

#### Import from Github

#### Select the project to deploy and click "Deploy"

#### Congrats 🎉 Your blog site is LIVE!

![deployed](https://i.ibb.co/TTPvHVF/image-2022-11-07-122304084.png)

Now, whenever you make changes to the `main` branch, Vercel will automatically update your site.
